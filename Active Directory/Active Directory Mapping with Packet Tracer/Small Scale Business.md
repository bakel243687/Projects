# Small Scale Business
Note: This is a fictional small scale business which I have decides to create an active directory for. This file consists of the process involved in mapping the active directory on Cisco Packet Tracer. This aspect of project is expected to take a week, of which I have spent two days so far

## Technologies Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer

### Setting up the Packet Tracer
To set up the environment for this project, picture the kind of business in question. In this case, it is grocery store with four main end users; Management, IT and 2 in Sales

### Mapping out the store
This may seem quite impractical for some small businesses, yet it is viable especially for bigger companies

Understanding the needed devices for the store which includes; four computers for the users, two switches, two servers and one router

With the needed devices in place, I gave a simple map out with the device yet to be configured.
